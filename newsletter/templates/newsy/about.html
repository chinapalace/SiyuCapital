    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        At Siyu Capital Insights, we digest the most pressing
        and pertinent trends in the equity, bond, and derivatives
        markets for you. Our weekly brief is geared at those who
        are trying to deepen their understanding of and broaden
        their interest in the world of investing and finance.
        Insights are intended to develop a more comprehensive
        investment view while underpinning sound personal finance
        learning as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our inspiration to write stems from daily engagement in
        the investment space across the asset classes delineated
        above. We take a granular, often esoteric look at specific
        challenges in markets, but also keep an overall
        macroeconomic sentiment at the core of our value proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
        No portion of any writing either within the weekly brief or on
        this website itself will ever take the form of actionable financial
        advice. We are not certified financial planners, chartered financial
        analysts, or chartered market technicians (although weâ€™re
        working on it). Go Bruins.
